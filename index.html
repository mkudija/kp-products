	<h1>Welcome to KP Products</h1>
	<p><a>Our rivet Fan Spacers are a sturdy tool that will last for many years of heavy use. They are manufactured and assembled in America from 1/32 type 304 Stainless Steel. Unlike less expensive imported products, the fingers are riveted at every intersection. This added care provides significant accuracy in the spacing of the rivets. All products are inspected and tested prior to shipment to ensure unrivaled performance.</a></p>
